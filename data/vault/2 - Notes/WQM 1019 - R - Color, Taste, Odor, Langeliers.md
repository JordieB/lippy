# Notes
## Vocab
PFAS 
- acronym for a group of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
- Man made chemicals introduced in products that resist heat, strains, grease, and water
- Perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFSO), Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Perflorohexanate Sulphonic Acid (PFHxS) 

THM
- Trihalomethanes
## Color
### What is it
- Common colors in water are pale yellow, green, or brown
- Amount of color is determined by measuring the amount of light the solution will absorb or by comparing the sample to solutions of known color
- Standard Methods Units: Color Units (CU)
- Treated surface water supplies 1 - 10 CU
- Groundwater: 0 - 5 CU
- Secondary standard Units: SMCL (15 CU)
- Measured against platinum-cobalt standard solution
	- Forms a yellow tint
	- limited to 15 CU for public water supplies

### What controls it
- Presence of minerals
- Aquatic organisms
- Organic matter from souls and vegetation
- industrial or municipal wastes
- iron and manganese

### Significance
- Affects consumer acceptance of drinking water
	- Would rather drink "less safe" water than water with color
- EPA does not consider color a toxic characteristic, instead it is a secondary (aesthetic) parameter affecting appearance and palatability.
- High amounts of organic compounds may produce high levels of trihalomethanes (THMs), like chloroform which is a considered to be a potential carcinogen, or other disinfection by-products (DBPs)
- Most states limit total trihalomethanes (TTHM) in public water supplies to 0.1 ppm (100 ppb)

### Sampling
- Should be completed routinely
- Raw water, finished water, and distribution systems
	- Raw to finished indicate plant efficiency
- Can be taken at consumer tap to help detect organic compound growths or corrosion in distribution system
- 50 mL in glass or plastic, analyze within 24 hrs

### Interferences
- Turbidity can make color more noticeable
- Extremely pH dependent - $pH \uparrow \;\; \rightarrow \; Color \Uparrow$ 
	- #WaterQuality/Comparisons
- Biological or physical changes during storage
- Dirty or scratched sample cells

### Analysis
#### Comparator
##### Reagents
- Color Standards - use a stock with a color of 500 Color Units
- Wheel of standards or liquid standards
- Distilled water
##### Equipment/Labware
- Nessler tubes 50 mL
- Volumetric flask
- Pipets
##### Procedure
- Fill the clean Nessler tube with 50 mL of the sample
- Compare sample with various color standards by looking downward vertically through the tubes towards a white surface
- match as closely as possible
- Estimating may be necessary if between standards

#### Spectrophotometric
