	- Arizona gets most of it's water from the Colorado River, but is cheapest
	- Water should be a right and not a commodity
	- Water supply chain requires capital
	- Cannot be scaled like modern industries
	- Water needs increase, but infrustructure cannot keep up
	- Current systems are crumbling
	- water costs cover running system, but not maintanence and upgrades
