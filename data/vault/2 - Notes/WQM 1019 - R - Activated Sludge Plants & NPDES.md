## Primary Treatment
- What is it?
	- Clarifier
	- Scum pit
	- Pumps
- What does it do?
	- Allows settleable solids to settle out
	- Removes floating debris
- Why is it important?
	- Reduces the organic loading of the plant
		- Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
			- Approx 50% - 70%
		- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
			- Approx 25% - 50%
	- Protects the plant against shock loads
		- Acts as a buffer for the aeration basins

### Aeration Basins
- Why is it important?
	- Creates an environment for microorganisms to "breakdown" the organics in the water
	- Reduces organics
		- BOD
			- Approx 85% to 98%
		- TSS
			- 85% to 99%
		- Nutrients
			- Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, Phosphorous

		- Mean Cell Residence Time (MCRT)
		- Food/Microorganism Ration (F/M Ratio)
## Secondary Treatment
- What is it?
	- Clarifier
	- Scum Pit
	- Pumps
		- Return Activated Sludge (RAS)
		- Waste Activated Sludge (WAS)
- What does it do?
	- Allows for settling of floc from aeration basin
- Why is it important
	- Separates heavy material (sludge) from water so that the supernate(clear liquid) can continue to the next stage of treatment
	- Some of the sludge is "wasted" from the system while the rest is "returned" to the aeration basin to continue breaking down the organics

		- Launder?
## Tertiary Treatment
- What is it?
	- Filters
- What does it do?
	- Final cleaning process before disinfection
- Why is it important?
	- Removes remaining inorganic compounds
	- Reduces nitrogen and phosphorous levels
	- Reduces microorganisms (Cryptosporidium)

## Disinfection
- What is it?
	- Chlorination, UV, Ozone
	- Contact Chamber
	- De-chlorination
- What does it do?
	- Kills or sterilizes microoganisms/potential pathogens
- Why is it important?
	- Public health
	- Prevents spread of waterborne diseases by **reducing** microbes and bacterial numbers to a regulated level

## Solids Handling
- What is it?
	- Drum thickener
	- Belt Press
	- Screw Press
- What does it do?
	- Reduces the amount (gallons) of sludge by "dewatering" the sludge before disposal
- Why is it important?
	- Money? (sold as fertilizer)

# NPDES Permits
## NPDES
- National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
- Permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into the waters of the US
- Created in 1972 by the **Clean Water Act**, the permit program is authorizes state governments (per the EPA) to perform many permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects of the program
