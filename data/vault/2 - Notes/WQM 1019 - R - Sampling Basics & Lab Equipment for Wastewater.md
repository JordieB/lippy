# Sample types
## Representative Sample
- Small quantity of something that accurately reflects the larger entity
- Must for having reliable sampling data

## Grab Sample
- Reflects performance only at the point in time it was collected
- Mainly used for samples that have low holding times (chlorine residual or pH)

## Composite
- Collection (series) of samples taken from the same location over a given period of time
- Usually over 8-24 hrs depending on sampling equipment
- All mixed together

# Analysis types
## Grab sample
- pH
- Temperature
- Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- Turbidity

## Composite
- Ammonia
- Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
- Metals
- W. E. T. Test

# Sample Preservation
- Some samples must be analyzed immediately (within 15 minutes)

### Methods
- Ice
- Refrigerator
- Hydrochloric Acid
- Sulfuric Acid
- Nitric Acid

# Recordkeeping
- Sampling methods, dates, and times
- Identity of the person(s) collecting the samples and sampling locations
- Dates the analyses wor performed and methods used
- Identity of the persons performing analyses and the results
- Retained for at least **3 years** sometimes longer
