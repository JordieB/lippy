## Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- Oxygen is measured in its dissolved form as DO
- Amount of free oxygen in the water
- Not considered a contaminant
	- Not regulated by EPA through SDWA
	- Known to be a requirement in some Wastewater Permits
- Required by fish and microorganisms
- Excess or insufficient DO will create unfavorable conditions

### Effects
- Excessive
	- Fish get "Gas Bubble" disease
		- ![[Pasted image 20230225090739.png|250]]
- Insufficient
	- Natural streams require oxygen to support aquatic life
		- If DO drops below 5.0 mg/L, aquatic life begins to experience stress
		- If DO remains below 1-2 mg/L for a few hours, large fish can die

### Significance
- Increases water palatability (most consumers prefer water that has DO)
- Can oxidize iron (Fe) and Manganese (Mn) into forms that will precipitate
- Helps degrade some organic compounds that cause taste and odor problems
- Can be used to indicate general water quality in raw-water reservoirs
	- May be able to alter treatment process or change the way reservoir releases are made
- High DO can be corrosive to metal pipes

- A covalent bond (also molecular bond) is a chemical bond that involves sharing electron pairs between atoms
- A hydrogen bond is an electro static attraction between two polar groups that occurs when a hydrogen atom, covalently bound to a highly electronegative atom (nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, etc.), experiences the electro static field of another highly electronegative atom nearby

### Converting
$$
\begin{align}
^{\circ}C &= (^{\circ}F - 32) \times 5 \div 9 \\
^{\circ}F & = (^{\circ}C \times 9 \div 5 ) + 32\\
\\
OR \\
\\
^{\circ}C &=\; (^{\circ}F - 32) \div 1.8 \\
^{\circ}F &=\; ^{\circ}C \times 1.8 + 32
\end{align}
$$

### Capacity
- Capacity goes down as temp goes up

#### Algae
- Blooms are very dense and can cause low DO
- During daylight, algae **produce** oxygen by photosynthesis which helps add oxygen to water
- During night time, algae **use** oxygen to survive. Lowest leves are just prior to dawn/sunrise 

### Testing
- Sodium Azide Modification (Winkler Method)
	- [Video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKdzbgHaQQM)
- Electrode
	- Hach DO Pen
	- BOD Probes
	- Probe has a cap that requires an electrolyte solution and membrane (cap) to be used
- LDO - Luminescent Dissolved Oxygen
	- Hach LDO probe
		- ![[Pasted image 20230225100242.png|200]]

### Interferences
- DO readings can be affected by the cleanliness of the equipment
- Chlorine, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide can behave like oxygen at the probe
- Equipment calibration

### Sampling
- Submerge sample bottle into water and rotate to point upstream
- Tilt slightly and cap
- Do not agitate
- Resample if there are any bubbles
- water line under pressure
	- attach a tube to a tap and extend the tube to the bottom of the bottle
	- Fill 2-3 to ensure no air entrapment
- Lake or reservoir
	- Most likely vary vertically
	- Examine the DO profile (DO vs. depth of reservoir)
- Stream
	- Change horizontally along the course of the waterway
		- Especially true in smaller, shallower streams
		- some vertical stratification in larger, deeper streams
#### Protocol
- DO levels change according to time of day, weather, and temperature
- If yearly comparisons are made, they should be done at the same time of day during the same season on a day with temp variation of $\pm 10^{\circ}C$ from previous measurement
- Decreases outside of normal historical parameters is usually an indication of an influx of some type of organic pollutant


## Chlorine Residual
### Significance
- Destruction of pathogenic organisms
	- Directly related to contact time and concentration
	- High dose = low contact time
	- Low dose = high contact time
- Chlorination oxidizes substances such as iron, manganese, and organic compounds allowing for removal with conventional treatment
	- Enough chlorine must be added to complete oxidation
		- Too much = wasted money, taste, odors, and increased THM production
		- Too little = incomplete destruction of pathogenic organisms, low residual in distribution system

### Process
- Added to source water as it enters the plant (pre-chlorination) and again before it leaves the plant (post-chlorination)
- Post-chlorination is utilized to provide continued disinfection in the distribution system
- Chlorine is also used in paper products, textiles, petroleum products, mecicines, food, solvents, paint, plastics, and many other products.

### Types
- Cl$_2$ gas
- Calcium hypochlorite tablets
- MIOX (Mixed Oxidant Solution) or on-site genertaion
	- Produced when a solution of sodium chloride is passed through an electrolytic cell and electricity is added. 
- Sodium hypochlorite (bleach)

### Breakpoint chlorination curve
![[Pasted image 20230225110755.png]]
- Combined residual and free available
1. - 2. First amount of chlorine added to raw water is destroyed by reducing (reacting with) compounds such as iron and manganese. When chlorine oxidizes iron or manganese no residual forms and disinfection occurs 
2. - 3. as more chlorine is added, it reacts with the organics and ammonia in water. This is the combined chlorine residual
	- Chlororganics and chloramine are formed
	- Compared to free chlorine residual, the combined chlorine residual has relatively poor disinfection power and may cause taste and odor issues
3. - 4. Chloramines and chlororganics are destroyed, reducing the combined chlorine residual
4. **Breakpoint** - Chlorine additions at this point form free chlorine residual (1:1 chlorine to chlorine residual)
5. Increase in Cl$_2$ beyond the breakpoint increases free, available Cl$_2$
	- Chlorine has already reacted to everything it can in the water
	- Free available is 25 times reactive than combined residual at disinfection
	- Will not produce swimming pool that combined residual does

- Free CL$_2$ **at the tap** should be at least 0.2 mg/L, but this is not regulated yet (2023)
- Disinfection level of at least 0.2 mg/L is required at the Entry Point to the Distribution System (EPDS)
-  0.2 mg/L minimum should be maintained throughout the distribution system (helps insure reduction of bacteria)
	- If unable to maintain, it may cause issues:
		- Stagnant water in dead ends
		- biological growths
		- contamination of mains during main break repair
		- cross-connection contamination
		- inadequate flow/usage

### Sampling
- Done at the treatment plant, distribution system (including point of use)
#### Treatment plant sampling
- Determines whether sufficient chlorine has been added to water before leaving the plant
- Observing representative samples is critical
	- Point near CL$_2$ injection would show disproportionately high CL$_2$
	- Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) requires water systems with populations > 3300 must have on-line continuous monitoring

#### Distribution system
- Used to determine if Total Coliform Rule is being met
- Low or no CL$_2$ (violation) = live pathogenic organisms and water quality issues may be present
- DPD analysis - about 10mL of sample is required
- Amperometric analysis - about 200 mL of sample is required
- Total or free residual chlorine samples may be collected in plastic or glass with minimal headspace to prevent chlorine evaporation

#### Protocol
- Usually collected in 500 mL HDPE plastic sample bottles
- Cannot be preserved, analysis must be completed immediately (15 minutes of collection)
	- CFR 40, Part 136.3, Table II, Footnote IV
- Avoid agitation or aeration
- Avoid direct exposure to sunlight (will break down CL$_2$)
- Do not use bacteriological sample bottles as they contain sodium thiosulfate (which neutralizes CL$_2$)

#### Analysis
##### N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) colorimetric 
- Simplest and quickest
- Can be used for free or total CL$_2$
- EPA approved
###### Interference
- Turbidity
- Bormine, iodine, ozone, oxidized forms of manganese and chromium may react with DPD reagent, resulting in false positive
- Bubbles
	- may interfere with the light passing through
- Dirt, finger prints, and scratches

##### Amperometric Titration
- More accurate than DPD
- Not for field use
- Not affected by color or turbidity
- More difficult to use as it requires training
- Uses PAO (Phenyl Arsnine Oxide) and buffers to titrate sample
