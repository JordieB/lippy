# Notes
## Vocab
- Colloidal matter
- Turbidity
- Alum - Acid that impacts alkalinity, can be used to lower pH in coagulated solutions with sufficient alkalinity
- coagulation
- flocculation
- aliquot - a division of a solution that was made in equal parts

## pH
- **p**(ower of) **H**(ydrogen) or **p**(otential of) **H**(ydrogen)
- Used to measure the acidity or basic something is
$H^+$ - Hydrogen Ion, missing an electron
$OH^-$ - Hydrogen Ion, has an extra electron

- Water exposed to air is slightly more acidic
	- Water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which reacts to the water, creating Carbonic Acid, which losers the pH
### Scale
- Image
	- ![[Pasted image 20230212174521.png]]
- 0 ph - Acidic (more protons)
- 7 pH - Neutral
- 14 pH - Basic (fewer protons)

### Intensity (Logarithmic)
- increases 10 time for each drop/rise of one unit on the pH scale
	- 5.0 ph is 10x more acidic than pH of 6.0

### Troubleshooting with pH
- Monitoring raw water quality can indicate potential problems
- Lake Destratification (Lake turn over)
	- Stratification - tendency of lakes to form separate and distinct thermal layers during warm weather
		- Cold water is more dense, causing it to sink to the bottom (maximum density of freshwater is 4$^{\circ}$C)
	- De-stratification 
		- Lakes will de-stratify during cooler windier weather with the surface mixing by wind. Often called "autumn turn-over"
		- This recirculates nutrients (particularly phosphorus compounds trapped in the lowest layer (Hypolimnion)
- Algal blooms
	- Utilize CO$_2$ during the day, increasing the pH
	- Release CO$_2$ at night which lowers the pH

### Regulations
- Parameters are required by the Lead and Copper Rule due to it being one of the factors for computing the [[WQM 1019 - S - Langelier Saturation Index (LSI)|Langelier Saturation Index (LSI)]]
- Secondary Drinking Water Standard MCL = 6.5 - 8.5 SU (Standard Units)

### Significance
- Water Treatment Plants
- CL$_2$ (Chlorine) disinfects water much faster and is 80% more effective at 7.0pH than over 8.0pH

### Impact of High and Low pH
#### High
- Increased halogen reactions -> increased DBP's and THM's
- In iron and copper pipes, will leave oxides (red/green stains onf ixtures and laundry)
- Bitter taste
- LSI goes up -> forms scale deposits

#### Low
- In metal pipes, it imparts metallic taste
- Sour taste
- LSI goes down -> corrosion

### Sampling
- Taken from raw water, finished water, or various stages of treatment
	- Monitoring aids in determining if artificual alteration is of pH is necessary to obtain suitable finished water
	- To increase: causic soda or aerations
	- To decrease: HCl or CO$_2$
- Samples are collected in glass or plastic
- to be collected without agitation
	- Loss or addition of CO$_2$ can impact pH levels
- Container should be filled ocmpletely and kept sealed prior to analysis
- Analysis 

### Analysis
- USEPA recommends monitoring pH in the field
- Should be run as soon as possible (15 minutes) and no later than 6 hours after collection 
- If transported to a lab, cool to $\le 4^{\circ}C$ w/ no preservatives, still less than 15 minutes after collection
#### Methods
##### Colorimetric (pH Paper)
- Uses color indicator disks
- Fast, no calibration needed
- Less expensive
- Not very accurate
	- Subject to interferences from color, turbidity, and dissolved solids
	- Indicator may deteriorate over time and alter the pH of the sample being tested
- Not to be used for reporting purposes

##### Electrometric (pH Probe)
- Images
	- ![[Pasted image 20230223082510.png|200]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230223082534.png|300]]
- Uses an electrode and meter
- Recommended
- Quick
- Requires calibration w/ solutions of known pH
- Very accurate
	- unaffected by outside influences
- Used for reporting

#### Process
- Class electrode is not subject to interference from color, turbidity, colloidal matter, oxidants, reductants, or high salinity
- Coatings of oil or particulate matter can impair electrode response
- Temperature effects
	- Use automatic temperature compensation probe or calibrate at the temperature of the samples
	- Always record temperature of the sample and calibration solutions, even when using automatic temperature compensation

### Common pH balances
| Liquid              | pH        |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| Vitamin water       | 2.5       |
| Coca Cola soda      | 2.63      |

## Alkalinity
- Measure of the water's capacity to neutralize an acid or it's ability to buffer a water
- Ability to resist changes in pH upon the addition of acids or bases
- Example
	- add the same weak acid solution to two vials of water - both with a pH of 7, but one with no buffering power (0 alkalinity) and the other with an alkalinity of 50 mg/l; the pH of vial 1 will immediately drop while vial 2 will change very little or not at all
- Based on bicarbonates ($HCO_{3-}$), carbonates ($CO_3^{2-}$) and hydroxides ($OH^-$) in water
	- Alkalinity = ($HCO_{3-}$) + 2($CO_3^{2-}$) + ($OH^-$) - ($H^+$)
- Unit is mg/L of $CaCO_3$
- Is important for controlling corrosion in piping systems

### Regulations
- No primary or secondary standards for alkalinity
- Monitoring and limits can be part of the Lead and Copper Rule requirements

### Significance
- Little is known about the impact of alkalinity on human health
- Can impact the efficiency of the coagulation and softening process when alum is used
	- Alum is an acid and impacts alkalinity in water supply
	- If alkalinity is sufficient, coagulation is complete, alum will dissolve in water and pH will not drop
	- If alkalinity is insufficient, may need to add soda ash, lime or caustic soda
- High alkaline (alkalinity?) water is unpalatable
- Low alkalinity levels cannot resist large changes in pH

### Sampling
- Raw water
	- Collect samples to determine the required chemical dosage at plant for effective coagulation and flocculation
- Finished water
	- collect samples to determine if water will be corrosive to the distribution system
#### Process
- Can be collected using glass or plastic
- Collect about 500 mL
- samples can be stored at $\le 4^{\circ}C$ for no more than 14 days
- No preservatives should be added

### Analysis
#### Electrometric
- Uses titrant (titration) and pH probe
- Slow and procedurally intensive
	- Reagents used in method deteriorate over time, must be replaced when expired
- Accurate but subjective
	- Uses acids, which can be subjective
	- Subject to interferences from color, turbidity, and dissolved solids (filter if needed)
- Used for reporting
#### Photometric
- Uses Hach DR 1900 Spectrophotometer and TNT+ 870
- Quick and simple
	- TNT vials have a shelf-life
- Relatively inexpensive
- Accurate (no biases)
	- Subject to interferences from color, turbidity, and dissolved solids (filter if needed)
- Used for reporting

## Conductivity
- Measure of a liquid's ability to conduct an electrical current
- Dependent on the total amount of dissolved salts or ions in the water
> [!question] What does this mean? 
> - Measured in mS/cm or mohms/cm, difference of 1000
> - Difference between μohms/cm and μS/cm)?  
> 	- Nothing; numerical values identical  
>	- Both references can be found

### What affects conductivity
- Lower the pH, higher the conductivity
	- Higher the conductivity, does not mean higher the pH (pH measures abundance of Hydrogen ions)
- Geology
	- Surrounding rock composition determines the chemistry of the watershed soil and ultimately the watershed
	- Limestone - increases conductivity
	- Clay soil - increases conductivity
	- Granite - does not dissolve readily so minimal increase to conductance
	- Groundwater often has higher conductivity
- Size of the watershed relative to the area of the lake/reservoir
	- Bigger watershed to lake surface area means relatively more water draining into the body of water because of a bigger catchment area
- Other sources of pollutants
	- point source pollutants such as wastewater from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, or industrial discharges
	- Non-point source pollutants
		- Urban runoff (like road salt)
		- Agricultural runoff (very high in dissolved salts)

### Ranges
- Distilled water - 0.5 - 3 $\mu S/cm$
- Surface water in the US - 50-500 $\mu S/cm$ @ 25$^{\circ}C$
- Groundwater - 100-1,500 $\mu S/cm$ @ 25$^{\circ}C$
- Streams supporting good mixed fisheries - 150-500 $\mu ohms/cm$
- Industrial waters - as high as 10,000  $\mu ohms/cm$

### Regulations
- No safe Water Drinking Act regulations for conductivity

### Significance
- Establish degree of mineralization to determine corrosion rates
- Evaluate variations in concentrations of dissolved minerals in source water (fluctuations in rivers/reservoirs)
- Estimate the concentration of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in water supplied to a dsitribution systemfrom various points (Colorado Springs Utilities uses a 0.6 multiplier of the conductivity to estimate TDS)
- Monitor for contamination
- Determine source of water being tested (water modeling, which plant produced the water, or which reservoir may have supplied the water
- Leak determination/complaint response)

### Sampling
- Use plastic or glass to collect a 500ml aliquot
- No preservatives, cool to $\le 4^{\circ}C$ 
- Analyze within 24 hours
	- Samples not analyzed within 24 hours should be run through a 0.45 micron filter and stored at $\le 4^{\circ}C$  for up to 28 days

### Interferences
- Goes up substantially with temperature (about 2% for every $^{\circ}C$)
	- Most meters utilize an internal temperature compensation program
	- If compensation is not present, you must measure sample at 25$^{\circ}C$

### Analysis
#### Electrometric
- Use Hach HQd Portable Meter with Conductivity Probe
- Simple and quick
- Subject to interferences from temperature
- Needs calibration
