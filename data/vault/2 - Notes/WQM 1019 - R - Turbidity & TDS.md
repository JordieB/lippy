## Turbidity
- Caused by particles suspended in water
	- These particles scatter or reflect light, making water appear cloudy
- Includes plankton, organic and inorganic matter
	- intensity of light as it passes through the sample
- Removed through filtration and/or coagulation
- Very little scattering (fogginess) = low turbidity
- High light scattering = high turbidity
- Not turbid vs. turbid

### What causes it?
- Soil erosion
	- Storm water runoff increases turbidity
- Urban runoff
	- Paved areas with dirt increase turbidity
- Wastewater and septic system effluent

### Measurement
- Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU)
	- Comes from the Greek "nephos" meaning cloud
	-  refers to the way that the instrument estimates how light is scattered by suspended particulates in the water
	- Measurements are made at 90$^{\circ}$ from the light source
- Used to evaluate in-plant operations
	- After settling and before filtration
	- coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation
	- Rise in turbidity after settling indicates a change in coagulant effectiveness
	- noticeable change anywhere in the process should be an immediate warning that operational adjustments are necessary
		- Plants will have alarms
		- May shut down filters due to inadequate treatment

### Normal ranges
- Raw water considered normal within 0 - 10 NTU
- +5 NTU noticeable to consumers
- Lakes - > 100 NTU impact fish ecosystem

### Regulations
- Finished water samples must be $\le$ 0.3 NTU (after filtration) for 95% of samples in each month
	- Cannot exceed 1.0 NTU after filtration at any given moment

### Significance
- Can create potential public health hazard, unpleasant appearance, and operational difficulties 
- Chlorine is only effective if it is able to make contact with the pathogenic organisms in the water and turbidity can decrease this
- Can "shelter" pathogens from disinfectants
- May contain particles of organic matter = increased Disinfection by Products (DBPs)

### Sampling
- Usually collected from raw water, sedimentation basin effluent, filter effluent (required by State) and finished water reservoir (required by State)
- On-line monitoring utilized to record results

#### Protocol
- Can be collected in glass or plastic
- 100 mL sample is sufficient
- Shake gently and analyze immediately after collection
- Level of turbidity can change if sample is stored
- Store for no longer than 24 hours

#### Interferences
- debris or rapidly settling coarse sediment
- Dirty or scratched glassware
- Bubbles
- Color

### Analysis
#### Equipment
- Sample cells with caps (30 mL)
	- Image
		- ![[Pasted image 20230225131737.png]]
	- Hand wash with lab soap, inside and out, rinse multiple times with DI water before air drying
- Oil Cloth  
- Turbidimeter

#### Reagents
- Silicone Oil
	- Has the same refractive index as the glass sample cells
- Stabilized Formazin Standards
	- Used for the instrument monthly/quarterly calibration. EPA recognized certification
- Gelex Secondary Turbidity Standards
	- Values determined after primary calibration
	- Standards used every time to check instrument calibration

#### Procedure
- Image
	- ![[Pasted image 20230225132429.png]]
- Calibrate per manufacturer's recommendation
	- Usually performed monthly or quarterly
	- Utilize secondary standard to verify accuracy before each analysis
- Turn on meter, allow it to warm up for 15 minutes. Verify the meter has been calibrated within the last month/quarter
- Gently
