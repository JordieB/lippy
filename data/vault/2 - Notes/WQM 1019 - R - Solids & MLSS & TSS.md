#Personal/Education/PikesPeak/WQM1019 #WaterQuality
- Municipal wastewater (influent) is made of roughly 99% water and 1% solids

# Classification of Solids
- Suspended Solids
	- Those solids are non-filterable and non volatilized at 103$^\circ C$
- Suspended Volatile Solids
	- That portion of the suspended solids which are volatilized at 550$^\circ C$
- Dissolved Solids
	- Those solids which are in solution and are therefore filterable (pass through the filter)
- Total Solids
	- All of the solids present, suspended or dissolved
- Total Volatile Solids
	- That portion of the total solids which are volatilized at 550$^\circ C$

# TSS and TVSS / MLSS and MLVSS
- TSS - Total Suspended Solids
- TVSS - Total Volatile Suspended Solids
- Suspended Solids are removed by filtration and weighted. Then ignited at 550$^\circ C$
- The remaining solids are **fixed (inorganic) solids**
- the solids that are lost are the volatile (organic) solids

# Methods of measuring
- 1
	- Insert glass fiber filter to filter flask filiter
	- Seat filter
	- Dry @ 105$^\circ C$
	- Ignite in muffle furnace @ 550 $^\circ C$ for 15 mins
	- Cool in drying oven
	- cool in desiccator to room temp
		- Provides 0% humidity atmosphere while crucible cools to room temp to prevent errors in weighing
		- Indicating dessicant is required (Blue = good, Pink = replace/recharge)
	- Weigh crucible
- TSS
	- Choose sample vol of 10 - 200 mils
	- Mix thoroughly
	- Place crucible on vacuum flask, wet filter
	- Pour sample into Gooch crucible
	- Filter with vacuum
	- Wash graduate, crucible, and filter with DI water
	- Dry crucibles plus solids for 1 hr @ 105$^\circ C$
	- Cool in desiccator to room temp
	- weigh crucible + suspended solids
- TVSS
	- Choose sample vol of 10 - 200 mils
	- Mix thoroughly
	- Place crucible on vacuum flask, wet filter
	- Pour sample into Gooch crucible
	- Filter with vacuum
	- Wash graduate, crucible, and filter with DI water
	- **Ignite in muffle furnace at 550$^\circ C$ for 15 mins**
	- Cool in drying oven
	- Cool in desiccator to room temp
	- weigh crucible + ash
# TSS Math Problem
> Problem:
> Your superintendent wants to know how efficient your primary clarifier was at removing solids during a major rain storm a few days earlier.
> 
> Your composite TSS sample of what was coming into the primary clarifier was 228 ppm and what was leaving was 87 ppm.
> 
> What do you tell the superintendent was the approximate percent removal?

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Efficiency} &= \frac{(\text{Value In} - \text{Value Out})(100)}{\text{Value In}} \\
\\
\text{TSS entering the primary clarifier} &= 228ppm \; \text{(or 228 mg/L)} \\
\text{TTS leaving} &= 87ppm \\
\\
\text{Efficiency} &= \frac{(228ppm - 87ppm)(100)}{228ppm}\\
\text{Efficiency} &= 61.8 

\end{align}

# MLVSS Procedure

- Mix thoroughly
- Place crucible on vacuum flask, wet filter

&= mg/L
\\
\\
\frac{\text{Wt. of Cruc. and Solids - Wt. of Cruc.}\; (grams)}{\text{Sample Volume} (mL)} &\times 1,000,000
\end{align}

# Volatile Suspended Solids (mg/L) Equation

# Dealing with odors
- Increase air flow to aerobic digesters for better air transmission
- Decrease percent solids concentration in aerobic digester for better air transmission

# Aerobic vs. Anaerobic
- Aerobic - free oxygen
- Anaerobic - No free oxygen
