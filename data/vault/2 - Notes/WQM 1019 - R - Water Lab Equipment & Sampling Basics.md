## iii. Procedures
### A. Surface Sampling
1. Use container that is clean from dust and other contaminants
2. Grasp sample container at base and submerge it mouth down
3. Position mouth into the current and away from your hand
4. If there is no current, create one by moving the container in the direction it is pointed
5. Tip container up to allow air to escape
6. Remove bottle from water
7. Seal tightly
8. Label w/ Collection date, time, type of sample, location, name of collector, and water temperature
9. Fill out chain-of-custody form if applicable
### B. Tap Sampling
1. Clean outer parts of the tap to prevent debris from falling into the container, disinfect if needed
2. Flush line by allowing running water until it reaches known temp of distribution mains in the area (4-5 mins). Do not turn the tap up to full as this may disturb incrustations and sediment in the line and contaminate the sample
3. Place container close to tap, but do not allow it to touch
4. Collect the sample
5. Seal tightly
6. Label w/ Collection date, time, type of sample, location, and name of collector
7. Fill out chain-of-custody form if applicable
### C. Sample Preservation
- Analyze samples ASAP
	- Some must be done immediately
	- Others must be analyzed months from now
	- Sooner the better
- Methods of preservation
	- Ice
	- Refrigerator
	- Hydrochloric acid
	- Nitric Acid
	- Sulfuric Acid
