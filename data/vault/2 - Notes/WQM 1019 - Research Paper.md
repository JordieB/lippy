Modern wastewater treatment has come a long way since having open sewer channels in the streets of ancient Rome. With the help of organic chemistry and microbiology, we have developed many tools and procedures for ensuring that wastewater is treated correctly and consistently before being re-introduced to the world. One such methodology is Gas Chromatography.

Chromatography is a scientific method that is widely used in the separation of components of a mixture. The method involves the distribution of the components of the mixture between two phases, namely the stationary and mobile phases. The stationary phase, liquid or solid, constrains many components and slows them down to help separate the phases. The mobile phase carries components of the mixture through the medium being used. The ratio of time spent in the moving and stationary regions is equal to the ratio of its concentrations in these regions (also known as the Partition Coefficient, or Adsorption Isotherm when talking about solids). There are many types of chromatography, including Thin Layer Chromatography, Column Chromatography, Gas Chromatography, Liquid Chromatography, Ion-exchange Chromatography, and Affinity Chromatography. Our main focus in this paper will be Gas Chromatography

Introduced in the early 1900s by Mikhail Semenovich, Gas Chromatography (GC) is a highly sensitive and selective technique used to detect and quantify trace amounts of compounds in a mixture. It is a widely used analytical technique for the separation and analysis of volatile organic compounds in a mixture. 

In wastewater management, gas chromatography is an important tool used to analyze the composition of wastewater. It is used to detect and quantify volatile organic compounds in wastewater, which can be harmful to the environment and human health. GC is preferred over Gas-Solid Chromatography (GSC) due to GSC's tendencies to have peak tailing and semi-permanent retention of polar compounds within the column.

The typical equipment used in gas chromatography consists of an injection port, a column, carrier gas flow control equipment, ovens and heaters for maintaining the temperatures of the injection port and column, and a detector. The process involves injecting the sample into the sample port, where it is vaporized. Modern equipment uses heated sample ports to immediately vaporize the injected sample. The sample volume is only a few microliters. The vaporization chamber is typically 50 degrees Celsius above the lowest boiling point of the sample.

The vaporized samples are then carried by an inert gas, often helium or nitrogen. The carrier gas varies in the GC used. It must be dry, free of oxygen, and chemically inert. Helium is most commonly used as it is safer but comparable to hydrogen in efficiency. It has a larger range of flow rates and is compatible with many detectors. Nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen are used depending on the desired performance and the detector being used. Hydrogen and helium are commonly used with Flame Ionization (FID), Thermal Conductivity (TCD), and Electron Capture (ECD) detectors. They have shorter analysis times and lower elution temperatures due to higher flow rates and low molecular weight. Helium and hydrogen give high sensitivity with TCD because of the difference in thermal conductivity between the organic vapor and hydrogen/helium than other carrier gasses.

The gas travels through a heated glass column packed with silica that is coated with a liquid. The column oven is used to heat the column. There are two types of temperature programming: isothermal programming, which is best suited for mixtures with a narrow boiling point range, and temperature programming, which is best suited for mixtures with a broad boiling point range. The temperature is increased continuously or in steps as the separation progresses. The remaining liquid is absorbed onto a solid inert packing or immobilized on the capillary tubing walls.

The gas runs into the detection system located at the end of the column, which provides a quantitative measurement of components. The detection system has two categories: bulk (general) properties and specific properties. Bulk properties are those that both the carrier gas and analyte possess in varying degrees, such as thermal conductivity, viscosity, and density. The most commonly used bulk property detector in gas chromatography is the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The TCD measures the thermal conductivity of the carrier gas and the analyte as they pass through the detector. The difference in thermal conductivity between the carrier gas and the analyte creates a signal that is proportional to the amount of analyte present in the sample.

Other bulk property detectors include the flame ionization detector (FID) and the electron capture detector (ECD). The FID detects organic compounds by ionizing them in a hydrogen flame and then measuring the resulting ion current. The ECD uses a radioactive source to ionize molecules in the carrier gas and detect any changes in conductivity caused by the presence of analyte molecules.

Specific property detectors, on the other hand, measure properties that are unique to the analyte being detected. These detectors are generally more sensitive than bulk property detectors and are used to detect trace amounts of specific compounds. Examples of specific property detectors include the mass spectrometer (MS) and the flame photometric detector (FPD). The MS can identify compounds based on their mass-to-charge ratio and is often used in conjunction with gas chromatography in a technique called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The FPD detects specific elements in a sample by measuring the light emitted when the sample is burned in a hydrogen flame.

The output of a gas chromatography analysis is a chromatogram, which is a graphical representation of the separation of the different components in the sample. The peaks on the chromatogram correspond to the different components that were detected by the detector. The area under each peak is proportional to the amount of that component in the sample.

Gas chromatography is an important tool in wastewater management because it allows for the detection and quantification of trace amounts of organic compounds in a sample. Many of these compounds, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, can have negative effects on the environment and human health even at low concentrations. By using gas chromatography to monitor the presence of these compounds in wastewater, scientists and wastewater treatment plant operators can take steps to reduce their impact on the environment and human health.

In conclusion, gas chromatography is a powerful analytical technique that is widely used in many fields, including environmental science and wastewater management. By separating and detecting the components of a mixture, gas chromatography allows scientists to identify and quantify trace amounts of organic compounds in a sample. This information can be used to monitor environmental pollution and take steps to mitigate its effects.
